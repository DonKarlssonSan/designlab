            <p>In the last decades, design has been asked to face great challenges and profound transformations. Its
              traditional approach to crafting and shaping the tangible world has been revolutionized by the way this
              very world has changed, becoming infused with digital technologies that have made it smarter, more
              interactive and connected.</p>
            <p>Recent technological developments have generated even more rapid and extreme changes. The emergence of
              AI, machine learning, flexible electronics, miniaturized and implantable sensors, and mixed synthetic and
              bio materials has not only provided designers with not only new design ingredients, but also generated
              new cultural and social landscapes they are asked to design in.</p>
            <p>This edition of the DeSForM conference intends to explore the implications of these recent and emerging technological transformations in the practice of design, with a particular focus on the aesthetics and
            human experience of these new systems.</p>
            <p>Designing beyond intelligence means that the design of such advanced smart ecosystems should go beyond their mere algorithmic thinking and functionalities. Scholars in the design field should start reflecting on the connections and mutual relations between the performance of these intelligent ecosystems and their physical appearances, aesthetics, interaction modality, and personality, towards the design of ecosystemic user experiences.</p>

        <div class="subtitle">Designing for connected and expressive artificial ecosystems</div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>DeSForM will bring you the best Dutch design can offer in collaboration with Design United and Philips Design. Participants will have a chance to experience the Dutch Design Week 2017 in Eindhoven, which starts right after the conference on October 21. This international event hosts exhibitions from a great variety of schools, companies and designers.</p>
          <p>DeSForM has traditionally dealt with the design of new, dynamic and interactive artifacts supported by the rise of intelligent systems (sensors, processors, algorithms, actuators, smart materials, etc.). Such systems are becoming more and more complex and sophisticated, giving birth to new forms of digital-physical hybridizations, i.e. ecosystems where advanced materials, sensing technologies, artificial intelligences, data, and humans are deeply interconnected and mutually shaped, in a dynamic way. These emerging hybrid ecosystems have already reached a point where their understanding, design, and evaluation ask for the development of new approaches and tools, as the experiences they create are far more complex to foresee and assess.</p>
          <p>In this edition, we challenge scholars in this field to start thinking beyond designing for and with intelligence embedded into single artifacts, to broaden their focus and start addressing designing for distributed, hyperconnected, and complex intelligent ecosystems, and how their meaning, experience, and ethics can be approached in this new landscape.</p>
          <p>This evolving context of design calls for new design skills and ways of thinking that is beyond the traditional field of design, as well as the creation of multi disciplinary and adaptable teams able to envision new interactive, interconnected and even unpredictable systems.</p>
          <p>The emergence of AI, robotic solutions, and big data connected with the spaces, objects and people we interact with everyday is going to create new landscapes for future generations. This also ask for new lenses to design and evaluate the impact of emerging technologies in our lives, requiring design to equip with new ethical paradigms.</p>
          <p>This conference intends to face the need to explore new frontiers for design, where emerging forms of distributed intelligence become design material, which should be fully investigated in terms of tangible manifestations, implications and impact on the design process, user experience, and social consequences. The conference will be structured around four main topics: Experiencing Complexity, Interacting with New Intelligences, Societal Impacts + Design Ethics, and Future Roles of Designers.</p>

        In 2005 DeSForM was born in (Eindhoven) the Netherlands with the premise of creating meaning through objects,
        interactions and people.
      </div>
      <div class="about-copy top">
        Over the years, the DeSForM community has explored and designed objects through a multisensorial approach
        always aiming at enriching users’ experiences with them. Throughout previous editions we have seen the
        development from digital and mechanical objects that had enriched sensorial presence to adaptive and
        intelligent objects that feel almost analogous to reality given their increased information processing power
        and sensory resolution. These are thanks to the recent developments in the material sciences, robotics,
        information and sensor technology, and improved production techniques. Consequently, the arena that belongs to
        design researchers and practitioners has gotten more sophisticated by being more technical, but also raises new
        questions regarding the effect and the impact of the new technologically rich designs. In 2017, DeSForM is
        returning to its place of birth opening up to a broader audience with deeper insights to debate about the
        future of dynamic “form” giving and its effects on people and their environment. The conference will be hosted
        by the industrial design schools of TU Delft and TU Eindhoven.

        DeSForM is an intimate, single-track conference that brings together design researchers, practitioners,
        students, and companies to have in-depth discussions over ongoing projects. It is an excellent platform for
        making new connections and bridging research interests. Therefore, we warmly invite multidisciplinary
        perspectives and discussions on current issues addressed in design research. Join us in Delft and Eindhoven and
        experience the rich and extensive design research and practice tradition that skillfully combines social
        sciences, arts and engineering to stimulate design-driven innovations!

          <p>At MIT, the Design Laboratory exists within a context of broad-based technological innovation and builds upon the unique advantages offered by this setting. It pursues research, executes practical design and art projects, and engages in scholarship and criticism. The Laboratory is organized as a collection of multidisciplinary research and project teams unconstrained by the traditional boundaries between the design, planning, and engineering professions and disciplines.</p>
          <p>The MIT Design Lab was co-founded in 2006 by William J. Mitchell and Federico Casalegno, who served as associate director. Between 2006 and 2010, the MIT Design Lab was a constellation of various MIT research groups. Sadly, Bill Mitchell died in 2010, but we’ve never stopped designing. Through the MIT Mobile Experience Lab, created in 2004 with Bill, Dr. Casalegno has continued to engage in advanced design research and celebrate design within MIT.</p>
          <p>The Design Lab, previously part of School of Architecture and Planning, is today within Comparative Media Studies and Writing (CMS/W) Department of School of Humanities and Social Sciences at MIT.</p>

        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>
            DesForM seeks to present current research into the nature, character and behaviour of emerging typologies of connected and intelligent objects within adaptive systems. It aims to bring together researchers in the many related fields of design to assess the outcomes of this research and begin to identify issues and territories for future investigation and exploration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our original working premise for this research was that forms, either concrete or abstract, always carry or mediate meanings. It is the responsibility of designers to make good use of these meanings, for example, to make products beautiful, to stress the importance of certain values, or to improve a product’s ease of use. Further, it should promote or negotiate enriched experiences between people and people, people and objects, and in time between objects (systems of objects) and objects. Design uses its own languages for this purpose, just as poets, painters, journalists, sculptures, filmmakers and other artists do. The role of multi-sensory perception should also be explored as a multiple channel to convey meaning.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe that our current conceptions of objects, things and artefacts need to be shattered once and for all so that we can be truly creative in how we contribute to the conceiving of the “new things”. This becomes even more important as emerging technologies and new forms of intelligence enrich and transform the nature of traditional objects and artefacts.
          </p>
          <p>
            DeSForM does this by inviting creative people from very different practicing contexts and representing somewhat different aspects of the design disciplinary spectrum. If we succeed in accumulating the views and the abilities each brings in the conceiving of ideas and things, then surely the results would be very, very different, and might even be important in driving the practice and discipline of Design forward in some way.
